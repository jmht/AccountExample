AccountExample
==============

This is a simple example of an **Account** domain object demonstrating an approach
to implementing GAAP double-entry accounting. In particular, the public 
transfer methods implement this strategy by transactionally (given the
appropriate transaction management) carrying out the offsetting credit
and debit together. The execution of the debit and credit actions are 
*private* to the **Account** and not exposed to clients.
